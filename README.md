This project uses a Logistic Regression machine learning model to detect phishing emails based on their content and metadata. The model provides predictions with confidence scores and explains the decision by highlighting key contributing words. A React-based frontend visualizes the results, including a chart and intuitive UI, helping users understand why an email is flagged. The system aims to improve email safety and awareness in a simple, user-friendly way.
